# My First Blog Post

This is my first blog post. I do not need to know html to make this post because I am using markdown.

This is easier than html while I am learning.

## Sub Title

Headings start with # in place of an html &lt;h1&gt;.

### Another Sub Title

Each # added makes the header smaller up to 6.

# Posting Markdown to My GitHub Pages

Unfortunately, markdown cannot be posted to GitHub pages.

Maybe I can paste it in from view source?

Let's see what that looks like.
